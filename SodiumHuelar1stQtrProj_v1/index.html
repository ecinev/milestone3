			<h2>Haven</h2>
			<p>As we grow up, we tend to face challenges that we thought we might not be able to overcome. We go through a lot of changes, whether they are emotional, mental, physical, academic, or spiritual. 
Some of those might prevent us from achieving success. However, they are all normal stages of development. We make mistakes, we cry, and we learn from them. But someday, when we look back, we might 
just laugh and regret the things we haven't done at times where freedom is still at hand.

Ages 13 to 19 may be the toughest and most unforgettable years of our life. This is where our minds go crazy!  Playing, Laughing, and Crying due to deadlines and examinations, socializing, 
and the butterflies you get whenever 'they' are near. But, as growing adults, it's not all fun and games. We must take care of ourselves, be self-sufficient, and bear several duties. And these obligations may 
exhaust us to the point that we forget to enjoy the moment.
That's why, Our Journey, This website is a one click away. It might or might not be a complete guide, but it will undoubtely assist and provide you with modest ideas that might be a solution to your huge problems.
