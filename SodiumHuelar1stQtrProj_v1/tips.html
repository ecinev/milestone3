                <h3>Procrastination?</h3>
                <p>Time management. 
                    As a student we were given an activity we should finish. And it is our responsibility to finish it on time. 
                    But sometimes, I feel unmotivated to work. As it leads to procrastination. 
                    So I would find something that could keep me motivated. 
                    For example, after I finish everything, I will play online games with my friends.  
                    Or other things that could give me energy like music, art, and reading stories. 
                    I could also make the due date my inspiration. "I have to finish this because the due date is near". 
                    I would always find something that could keep me going. Or Set schedules and to-do lists.

                    <h3>What's your love?</h3>
                    <p>
                        As young people, we'd sometimes feel this strange feeling whenever a specific person is around.
                        Like these: "Do you believe those who say, "I feel butterflies when I see you?" Do you? Do you?!?!
                        I don't. Because rather than butterflies, I feel crows and peacocks doing a little silly dance, which tickles the insides of my body.
                        the way your heart beats fast whenever they look back at you. Because I'd feel this electricity, struck by lightning, and it made my knees feel weak, my heart shook, deadâ€¦"
                        Well, maybe I am overexaggerating or maybe not. But one thing's for sure. The feeling of loving and being loved is splendid!
                        But, do note that love just not only involves your "specific person". You could also love your friends, family, classmates and a lot more!
                        There are a lot of ways to express our love to others. And it varies for each person. Like for me, I like to express my love through
                        spending time with them. To better express your love, you have to identify what type of love you like recieving and you like reciprocating.
                        Let us learn the different love languages! 
                        So what's your love?
