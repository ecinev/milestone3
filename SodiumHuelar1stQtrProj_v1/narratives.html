                <h1>Short Narratives</h1>
                <h3>Cruel is Beeautiful</h3>
                <p>"Shhh" He shushed the little girl crying in his arms.
                    "Don't cry brat"
                    Not hearing the man's words, she kept crying in agony as she hid at the man's embrace,
                    "They got murdered" she said in her tremulous voice,
                     traumatized at the scene earlier.
                    A 7 year old girl was seen at the huge manor crying alone seeing her parents getting murdered in a brutal manner before 
                    her eyes while her siblings was taken away. Hiding in the closet feeling helpless. Such a traumatic scar that she will 
                    have to endure for a lifetime.
                    The family was envied by many, how good looking, how smart, how rich, such nobles living in a faraway forest, 
                    where peace exists,  where warmth and love was shared. But are mistaken by many, alot thought that they are such greedy 
                    people, but how can an innocent peaceful family can be seen so violent? I guess people, assume too much or rather they 
                    are too creative with their own ideas.
                    The pleas of the little young girl are still alive at this man's heart. He couldn't even imagine if he was in her situation, children like her should be playing doing things they want to do, but I guess the world is too cruel for a young innocent girl,
                    A world where you can experience satisfaction yet you can experience hunger, a world where you experience warmth yet can 
                    experience cold, a world where  cruel is  beautiful....</p>

                <h3>Nasan na Shay?</h3>
                <p>"Shay alam mo ba, pagod na ako." 

                    "Bakit ba?" Tanong ni Shay.
                    
                    "Ako'y nag-review mula sa pag lubog ng araw hanggang sa pag sinag nito "  sabi nito at itinuon ang kanyang atensyon sa kanyang binabasa na libro
                    
                    "Edi, huwag na mag-aral" tawa pa niyang sabi.
                    
                    "Ang taas ng expectations saakin, hindi pwede yan Shay." At ang nailing na laming ay ang bulong ng hanging.
                    
                    "Diba Shay?"
                    
                     Tiniklop nito ang kanyang libro, ngunit sa kanyang pagtataka, walang Shay na sumagot.
                    
                    "Shay-?" Inilingon niya ang kanyang ulo at walang Shay na nakita. Tumayo ito sa kanyang inuupuan at lumabas Para hanapin si Shay.
                    
                    "Shay! Shay?" Paulit ulit nitong tawag ngunit walang Shay na tumugon, habang nilibot ang buong paralan.
                    
                    "Shay? Nasaan ka na ba?!?" Ang mga luha'y dumaloy na para bang agos ng ulan.
                    
                    "Shayâ€¦. Nasan ka na ba-..." hinihingal nitong tawag. Silid-aralan, silid-aklatan, kahit saan. Shay ay hinahanap.
                    
                    Pumasok ito sa isang cr at nakita si Shay na Pawis na pawis, umiiyak. 
                    
                    "Shay!" Inabot nito ang kanyang nanginginig na kamay.
                    
                    "S-shay, sa wakas at n-nahanap na rin kita." 
                    Sambit nito sa harap ng isang gintoang salamin.

                <h3>I love rainy days</h3>
                <p>I love rainy days
                    The Pouring of the rain.
                    The sound it makes when it touches the ground.
                    And the cold wind.
                    Sitting beside the open window.
                    As tiny droplets of water. 
                    Somehow made its way through.
                    Despite its coldness.
                    I feel warmth.
                    I feel comfort
                    I feel full.
                    The coldness was never enough
                    Listening to the harmonious music that nature makes.
                    As it plays a pretty tune.
                    Looking up above.
                    You can clearly see.
                    How those dark clouds move at a fast pace.
                    The smell.
                    Remains a nostalgic impression.
                    Now, the rain is dying down.
                    Whilst watching everything from the start.
                    Till the end.
                    I still could never get enough.
                    The rainy days.
                    Of yesterday.
                    So Peaceful.
                    Felt Blissful.
                    I wish that it can continue.
                    Raining.
                    For eternity.
