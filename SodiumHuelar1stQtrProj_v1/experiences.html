                <h3>Most Unforgettable Experience</h3>
                <p>I don't know where to start so I decided to start listing my most unforgettable experience. Actually they are a lot to
                    list, I just couldn't remember most of them. The first one would be when I went to Baguio to join a national competition.
                    Since it is my very first national competition, I'm in the brink of having a nervous breakdown. Despite the fact that I have 
                    confidence in myself, but competing with students who're as smart or who are more smarter than me just gave me the chills.
                    I had a lot of fun tho. Even though I didn't win because of some "unfair reason." And yet, it taught me something new.
                    That even though you played fair, but fair won't always win. And you won't always win, because someone would always be better than you.
                    So better be down-to-earth. Okee? OkeEE! (my op pic)
